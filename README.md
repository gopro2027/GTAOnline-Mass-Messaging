# GTAOnline-Mass-Messaging
Most of the code in this project is the 'Alpha' mod menu base by maxiZzModz

I used his base and added the functionality for sending messages

This code does not breach any extra security nor uses any crazy exploits, it just uses some natives available in the game normally

Most of the code for the mass messaging is located at the end of the `Functions.cpp` file

I take no responsibility for whatever this code is used for.
